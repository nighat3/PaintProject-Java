\
(1) Issues with our submitted code: no issues visible to us\
\
\
(2)We did not discuss or share our code with anyone else.\
\
\
(3) Clarifications about code:\
       \
     (a) We wanted to clarify that as the color of the eraser changes, the background color doesn\'92t update. We thought it would need to change until we read on piazza that it does not need to change.\
\
     (b) When the color chooser dialog pops up, we wanted to be sure that absolutely nothing was to be done if the user hit \'93cancel\'94 instead of choosing a color, so we left the if statement for when the dialog box\'92s return value is null empty.\
